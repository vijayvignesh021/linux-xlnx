  Xilinx High-Level Synthesis Core (HLS)
  High-Level Synthesis cores are synthesized from a high-level function
  description developed by the user. As such their functions vary widely, but
  they all share a set of common characteristics that allow them to be described
  by common bindings.

properties:
  compatible:
    items:
      - enum:
          - xlnx,v-hls

  reg:
    maxItems: 1

  clocks:
    description: Reference to the video core clock.
    maxItems: 1

  ports:
    type: object

    properties:
      "#address-cells":
        const: 1

      "#size-cells":
        const: 0

      "port@0":
        type: object
        description:
          port@0 is input. similarly port@1 would be output.

        properties:
